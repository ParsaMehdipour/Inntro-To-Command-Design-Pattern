# Inntro-To-Command-Design-Pattern

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.
